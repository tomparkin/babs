 * Add an init script (upstart job?) to start babs at boot
 * Tidy up test suite output a little
 * Support symbolic hostnames as well as IP for slave description in the .ini file
 * Support IPv6
 * Vagrant test infrastructure
 * Refactor core libs -- perhaps just a single library script?
 * Allow more flexible configuration reload, ensure we don't drop build reports in any case
 * Rework build directory naming; would be nice to order by date
 * Integrate jobrunner functions into main babs script: the master will be the slave, and vice versa
