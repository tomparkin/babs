 * Add an init script (upstart job?) to start babs at boot
 * Refactor jobrunner to run as a subcommand of babs rather than separate script
 * Tidy up test suite output a little
 * Support symbolic hostnames as well as IP for slave description in the .ini file
 * Rework build report emails -- get rid of the "Autobuilder" references
 * Allow more flexible configuration reload, ensure we don't drop build reports in any case
 * Rework build directory naming; would be nice to order by date
