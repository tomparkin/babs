# A Tungsten-flavoured autobuilder system supporting machine pools
#

This codebase implements a distributed build server infrastructure.  It's
somewhat tailored to the requirements of Tungsten STB projects, and the
core functionality for passing messages around a distributed system using
BASH and ssh is reusable.

For notes on how to setup and use the autobuilder script, please see USAGE.txt.
