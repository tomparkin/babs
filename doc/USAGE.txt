INSTALLATION
############

On the master machine:

   1. Ensure the master has password-free SSH keys for each of the slaves
      in the build farm pool.  The master will log in as the user running
      the autobuilder script.

   2. sudo yum install inotify_tools

   3. Copy autobuilder.ini to /etc/autobuilder.ini.  Edit
      it for your desired configuration, including the IP addresses of the
      hosts in the build pool.

   4. Install the autobuilder tarball:

         sudo tar -xf autobuilder-XYZ.tgz -C / 

   5. Edit /etc/autobuilder.ini for your configuration.
  

On each slave machine:
 
   1. sudo yum install inotify_tools

   2. Ensure each slave has password-free SSH keys for the master machine.
      The slave will log in as the user running the jobrunner script.

   3. Install the jobrunner tarball:

         sudo tar -xf jobrunner-XYZ.tgz -C / 

RUNNING
#######

On the master:

   1. Run the autobuild process:

      /opt/autobuilder/bin/autobuilder run

   2. Arrange for something (e.g. cron job) to periodically generate an SCM
      scan event:

      /opt/autobuilder/bin/autobuilder scan

On each slave:

   1. Run the jobrunner process:

      /opt/jobrunner/bin/jobrunner run


Once the system is up and running you can request information from the
autobuilder by running various commands.  The autobuilder script accepts
the "-h" argument to print usage information.
